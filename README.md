Multimodal Processing Capabilities
Visual Processing Module

Dual-Stream Architecture:

Ventral Stream ("what" pathway): Object recognition and feature identification
Dorsal Stream ("where/how" pathway): Spatial processing and movement detection


Visual Attention: Multi-head attention for selective visual focus
Visual Working Memory: Stores recent visual representations
Executive Visual Control: Frontal lobe can direct visual attention to specific regions

Audio Processing Module

Dual-Pathway Processing:

Spectral Pathway: Frequency analysis and pitch detection
Temporal Pathway: Rhythm and timing analysis


Audio Attention: Selective listening mechanisms
Pitch Detection: 12-semitone pitch class recognition
Rhythm Detection: 8-pattern rhythmic analysis
Auditory Working Memory: Stores recent audio features

Multimodal Integration Module

Cross-Modal Attention: Binds visual, audio, and cognitive information
Temporal Coherence: Maintains synchronized multimodal representations
Modal Projection: Transforms different modalities into common feature space
Binding Network: Creates unified multimodal representations

üß¨ Enhanced Neurochemical Integration
The four neurotransmitter systems now modulate all modalities:

Dopamine: Enhances motivation-driven attention across vision/audio
Norepinephrine: Boosts arousal and attention focus in all modalities
Serotonin: Regulates mood effects on perceptual processing
Acetylcholine: Enhances learning and attention across modalities

üîÑ Advanced Training Features
Multimodal Loss Functions:

Visual stream consistency (ventral-dorsal coordination)
Audio stream consistency (spectral-temporal coordination)
Cross-modal attention optimization
Pitch and rhythm prediction accuracy
Executive attention control loss

Scenario-Based Training:

Learning/Focus: High acetylcholine and norepinephrine
Stress Response: High dopamine and norepinephrine, low serotonin
Creative/Relaxed: High serotonin, moderate other neurotransmitters

üåê Multi-Network Ecosystem
The system now supports:

3+ Interconnected Networks: Frontal lobe, visual cortex, auditory cortex
Multimodal Communication: Networks exchange visual, audio, and cognitive signals
Cross-Modal Learning: Networks learn from each other's multimodal experiences
Attention Coordination: Executive control coordinates attention across networks

üìä Comprehensive Analysis Tools
New visualization capabilities:

Neurochemical Dashboard: Real-time neurotransmitter levels
Visual Stream Analysis: Ventral vs dorsal activation patterns
Audio Feature Analysis: Spectral vs temporal processing balance
Executive Control Visualization: Attention control signals
Multimodal Integration Metrics: Cross-modal binding strength

This creates a biologically realistic, fully integrated system that processes vision, audio, and cognitive information while maintaining neurochemical modulation and multi-network communication - essentially a complete frontal lobe executive function system with multimodal sensory integration!
The system can now handle real-world scenarios like watching a video while listening to music, reading while in a noisy environment, or any complex multimodal cognitive task that requires executive control and attention management.
